The purpose of this analysis is to choose from 50 different datasets for AMAZON VINE and utilize PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS(Relational Database Service) and load the transformed data in pgAdmin.  Using PySpark to determine if there was any bias towards providing favorable reviews in the selected dataset.
